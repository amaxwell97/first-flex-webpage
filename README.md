# first-flex-webpage

## First webpage styled with flexboxes as part of the Odin Project.

https://amaxwell97.github.io/first-flex-webpage/

This project was built as part of the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations">Odin Project's Foundations Course</a> (more specifically, the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page">Felxbox section</a>). The purpose of the project was to demonstrate, practice, and implement my knowledge of HTML, CSS (no Bootstrap), Flexbox, and Git. All styling in the project is through CSS. Within the project I:

* Set up the HTML boilerplate.
* Linked the CSS stylesheet and the fonts to be used from Google Fonts within the HTML doc.
* Added a simple nav bar with flex properties that links to each section within the HTML doc.
* Set up a basic title section that felxes, includes a customized button, utilizes hierarchal selectors, and explains the purpose of the page and links to a picture.
* Implemented a set of four content cards and accompanying description boxes that flex so as the screen size decreases, the number of cards per row decreases.
* Created the images that fill the content cards in Photoshop from a series of seperate images that I cropped and put together.
* Included a testimonial section that utilizes media queries, flex boxes, and flex properties so that when the screen shrinks to certain sizes, the image moves above the text and the text itself spills onto the next lines.
* Added a call-to-action section with it's own container and customized button which utilizes CSS hover state.
* Lastly, set up a simple footer which includes my copyright information.

## My Thoughts
